<h1>Classifying Rocks</h1>

<h2>Igneous Rocks</h2>

<div>
<p>Igneous rocks are rocks that have cooled and solidified from a melt.  They are also sometimes called crystalline rocks.  Igneous rocks are often described or classified by their texture and their mineral assemblage. </p>

<h2>Sedimentary Rocks</h2>

<div>
<p>Sedimentary rocks are rocks that have been formed from fragments, or mineral grains, of other rocks.  Like igneous rocks, sedimentary rocks can be classified by the characteristics of their mineral grains as well as their texture.  Sedimentary rocks are unique in that they sometimes contain fossils, whereas igneous and metamorphic rocks usually do not. </p>

<h2>Metamorphic Rocks</h2>

<div>
<p>Metamorphic rocks are rocks that have been altered by pressure and temperature.  When rocks are metamorphosed, they develop new minerals and new textures.  Metamorphic rocks are sometimes called foliated rocks. </p>
